# The Lost Song of Despair

Wield the power of Metal against hordes of enemies to find the pieces of the Song of Despair. 
This is a twin-stick (but with KB+Mouse) shooter in which you control a badass platypus who has to collect 4 cassetes, each with the instrument track of a song. 
For each one you get, the more powerfull you become. When you collect all of them, you will have to hold your ground untill the full song finishes.


### Two modes:
* Story: an epic platypus chronicle with metal and lightning
* Endless: How many songs can you listen before being killed by monsters?

### Controls:
WASD to move our hero
LEFT CLICK of mouse to shoot where the mouse pointer is
